## Problem Statement

The problem/pain this project aims to solve is the need to automate notifications for new files uploaded to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. Specifically, the project creates a solution that:

1. Monitors an S3 bucket for new file uploads.
2. Triggers a Lambda function to process the uploaded files.
3. Sends a notification via mail using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).
4. Stores metadata about the processed files in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) for further downstream processing. 

## Key highlights of the project

1. Seamless Integration: Discover how to effortlessly integrate Amazon S3 into your existing workflows, along with Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Lambda, SNS, CloudWatch and SQS.

2. Real-Time Notifications: Learn how to set up a notification system pipeline that instantly alerts your team whenever a new file is uploaded, keeping each and everyone in the loop, hence enabling quick action!

3. Scalable and Secure: Explore how Amazon S3's scalability and industry-leading security features can provide peace of mind, allowing your organization to grow without compromising the safety of your critical data. 

4. Improved Efficiency: Recognize how this automated file upload detection system can save your team valuable time and effort, enabling them to focus on more strategic initiatives instead of manual data management tasks.
